# iOS-Xcode-Templates
New file templates for Xcode

Installation: ``cp Flybits ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/``

These templates simplify your use of the Flybits SDK, from creating new APIs for your custom ``Moments`` to creating your very own ``ContextDataPlugin``.

## API.xctemplate
Allows you to take advantage of the Flybits API request paradigm to create your very own API requests for use with the Flybits SDK (inspired by the guys at [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)).

## Context Plugin.xctemplate
Create your very own Context Plugin for use with the Flybits SDK, track anything from your heart rate to something only your IoT gaget can track! The world is your oyster (just don't eat too many!)

## Moment Model.xctemplate
This template can get you started with interpreting all that ``Moment`` data, using our ``ResponseObjectSerializable`` protocol, simply define your properties and assign their values!

## Moment.xctemplate
Basically we took the ``UIViewController`` template and imported the ``FlybitsSDK`` module. Enjoy!
